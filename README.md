## Context

The Radar is a document that sets out the changes that we think are currently interesting in software development — things in motion that we think you should pay attention to and consider using in your projects. It reflects the idiosyncratic opinion of the Holaluz tech community and is based on our day-to-day work and experiences.

We aim to run the Radar exercise twice a year.

## Concepts

### Blips

A blip is a technology or technique that plays a role in software development. Blips are things that are ‘in motion’ — that is we find their position in the Radar is changing – usually indicating that we’re finding increasing confidence in them as they move through the rings.

### Quadrants

The quadrants are a categorization of the type of blip:
  - **Programming Languages and Frameworks**. This section is self-descriptive, it includes the programming languages we use like PHP and frameworks like Symfony.
  - **Tools**. These can be components, such as databases, software development tools, such as versions control systems; or more generic categories of tools, such as the notion of polyglot persistence.
  - **Platforms**. Things that we build software on top of such as mobile technologies like Android, virtual platforms like the JVM, or generic kinds of platforms like hybrid clouds.
  - **Techniques**. These include elements of a software development process, such as experience design, and ways of structuring software, such as microservices.

We don't make a big deal out of the quadrants — they’re really just a way to break up the Radar into topic areas. We don't think it's important which quadrant a blip goes into, unlike the rings – which generate a lot of discussion.

### Rings

The metaphor of a radar says that the closer a blip is to you, the sooner it will be on top of you. Like most metaphors, you can't take it too seriously, but there's an essential sense to it.

Our Radar has four rings, which we'll describe starting from the middle:

- The **Adopt** ring represents blips that we think we should all be using. We don't say that you should use these for every project, but there should be a clear reason to use an alternative.
- The **Trial** ring is for blips that, we think, are ready for use as at least one team has proven the value. We think you should use these on a trial basis, to decide whether they should be part of our general toolkit. 
- The **Assess** ring are things to look at closely, but not necessarily trial. Typically, blips in the Assess ring are things that, we think, are interesting and worth keeping an eye on.
- The **Hold** ring is for things that, even though they are accepted in the industry, we haven't had a good experience with or are being faced out. 

Unlike the quadrants, we do have some quite passionate arguments about which ring a blip should go into. We don't tend to have angry arguments, but rings are what generate the most energetic discussions. Over the course of making the Radar we've come up with some useful rules of thumb to help us put things into rings:
- We can only put blips into the Trial ring when we have experience of that blip on a real project. 
- For the Adopt ring, we only include items when we think it would be a poor and potentially irresponsible choice not to use them given the appropriate project context.
