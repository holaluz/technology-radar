CI/CD,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"CI/CD bridges the gaps between development and operation activities and teams by enforcing automation in building, testing and deployment of applications. CI/CD services compile the incremental code changes made by developers, then link and package them into software deliverables. Automated tests verify the software functionality, and automated deployment services deliver them to end users. The aim is to increase early defect discovery, increase productivity, and provide faster release cycles. The process contrasts with traditional methods where a collection of software updates were integrated into one large batch before deploying the newer version. Modern-day DevOps practices involve:
- Continuous integration: Frequent merging of several small changes into a main branch</br>
- Continuous delivery: When teams produce software in short cycles with high speed and frequency so that reliable software can be released at any time, and with a simple and repeatable deployment process when deciding to deploy</br>
- Continuous deployment: When new software functionality is rolled out completely automatically</br>

ADRs,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"An Architectural Decision (AD) is a justified software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant. An Architecturally Significant Requirement (ASR) is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software system’s architecture and quality. An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures a single AD and its rationale; the collection of ADRs created and maintained in a project constitute its decision log.

Everything as Code,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"Treating all components of a system as code is known as Everything as Code. It means that you can store both the source code and configuration in a repository like a git or svn.</br>
In addition, the configuration can be stored from top to bottom (communication switches, bare-metal servers, operating system, build configurations, app properties, deployment configurations as codes) so that they can all be tracked and easily recreated.</br>
Everything as Code (EaC) also includes system design which is stored as code. Infrastructure was essential in the old IT world.

Async Comunication by Default,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"Asynchronous messaging and event-driven communication are critical when propagating changes across multiple microservices and their related domain models. As mentioned earlier in the discussion microservices and Bounded Contexts (BCs), models (User, Customer, Product, Account, etc.) can mean different things to different microservices or BCs. That means that when changes occur, you need some way to reconcile changes across the different models. A solution is eventual consistency and event-driven communication based on asynchronous messaging.</br>
When using messaging, processes communicate by exchanging messages asynchronously. A client makes a command or a request to a service by sending it a message. If the service needs to reply, it sends a different message back to the client. Since it's a message-based communication, the client assumes that the reply won't be received immediately, and that there might be no response at all.</br>
